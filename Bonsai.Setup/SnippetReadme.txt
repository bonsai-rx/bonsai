This folder exists to allow building a user library of workflow snippets.

In order to add workflow snippets, create subfolders with category names
containing Bonsai workflow files (*.bonsai). Any workflow files included
in each subfolder will show up as an individual module in the editor toolbox.

Example folder structure:
Snippets (root)
|--Audio
   |--Capture.bonsai
   |--Record.bonsai
|--Vision
   |--BrightFilter.bonsai
